This is a project directory structure for a machine learning application that includes a CNN model, a Flask mobile app, a MongoDB server, and Docker and Kubernetes infrastructure. The `models/` directory contains the code for the CNN model and any related utility functions. The `api/` directory has the code for the Flask API and the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file. The `mobile_app/` directory holds the code for the mobile app. The `database/` directory has the code for the MongoDB database. The `docker/` directory contains the Docker files for each component of the application and the `kubernetes/` directory has the configuration files for deploying the application on a Kubernetes cluster using deployment and service files.
